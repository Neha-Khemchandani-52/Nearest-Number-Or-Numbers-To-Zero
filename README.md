# Nearest-Number-Or-Numbers-To-Zero

Hello Everyone,

This program will find the nearest number to zero from array of given numbers like if only one nearest number +ve or only -ve  number to zero is given then it will return that positive number or negative number if both are given then it will return both +ve and -ve nearest numbers to zero for example 1 and - 1 so it will return both these numbers because both are nearest numbers to Zero(0).
